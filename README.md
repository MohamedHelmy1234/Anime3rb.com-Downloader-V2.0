# General Idea
This app is designed to automate the process of downloading anime from the internet.

It uses some built-in libraries like os, threading, time and collections->deque.

It also uses other libraries like requests and bs4, they are included in the ```requiremnets.txt``` file.

# Installation

Just install the libraries in the ```requirements.txt``` file or just run - in your terminal/cmd - ```pip install -r requirements.txt```

# How to run

Make sure to run main.py as adminstrator or just use the ```run.bat``` file.

# Other Notes

This app only supports anime3rb.com links like ```https://anime3rb.com/titles/naruto```.

The app will store the downloaded episodes in a folder named output in the same folder as ```main.py```.

# Enjoy ^^
